# Test Abbreviations

In this document there are two abbr defined - `SUN` and `pp`.

from the global space should be enabled: `HTML`, `W3C`, `I2C`, `UART`.


Mikrocontroller often use I2C for communications.

The SUN shines today!

Another older interface is UART - most times it is a point to point connection.

HTML is a nice way to do things?!

*[SUN]: big bright light
*[pp]: Ping Pong
